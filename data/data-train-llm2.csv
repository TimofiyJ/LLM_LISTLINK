"Inspired by his previous ""Crossing"" in Iceland last fall, #OspreyAthlete Payson McElveen @paysonmcelveen has knocked another traverse off his list. With the help of Tasmanian endurance rider @oneflukeshot, Payson pieced together a 360 mile route across Tasmania that crescendoed in difficulty, beginning on the wild, largely uninhabited northwestern coast and concluded on the white sand beaches of the Bay of Fires after 32 hours and over 34,000 feet of climbing. 

The island brought him face-to-face with three Tiger Snakes, one of the most venomous on the planet, hundreds of wallabies and wombats, and the friendly locals of Tasmania's rural communities.

The forthcoming film, produced in conjunction with Joey Schusler and Thomas Woodson and edited by Aidan Haley, will premier at the 2023 Sea Otter Classic and aims to share stories far beyond the athletic achievement of this ride.
