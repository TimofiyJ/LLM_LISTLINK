I am so proud and excited for the Extended Fit packs to be launched! Consulting on it was a true joy of my career so far, and I can’t wait to do more. Read more on the Behind the Scenes from this project at Osprey.com or the link in my bio!

"Inspired by his previous ""Crossing"" in Iceland last fall, #OspreyAthlete Payson McElveen @paysonmcelveen has knocked another traverse off his list. With the help of Tasmanian endurance rider @oneflukeshot, Payson pieced together a 360 mile route across Tasmania that crescendoed in difficulty, beginning on the wild, largely uninhabited northwestern coast and concluded on the white sand beaches of the Bay of Fires after 32 hours and over 34,000 feet of climbing. 

The island brought him face-to-face with three Tiger Snakes, one of the most venomous on the planet, hundreds of wallabies and wombats, and the friendly locals of Tasmania's rural communities.

The forthcoming film, produced in conjunction with Joey Schusler and Thomas Woodson and edited by Aidan Haley, will premier at the 2023 Sea Otter Classic and aims to share stories far beyond the athletic achievement of this ride.

Tyler’s brother, writer Jordan Green (@jordangreenwords), helped document Tyler’s preparation and experience for this year’s race, giving us an insider’s perspective into what it truly takes to walk—er, run—in Tyler’s shoes. Needless to say, we’re awed.

"Did you know that we’re proud members of @conservationalliance who recently announced the Dolores River in Colorado as one of their four Advocacy Priority Campaigns for 2022? Beginning high in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado, it flows 230 miles until it joins the Colorado River in Utah’s red rock desert near Moab. McPhee Dam and Reservoir were built in the 1980’s to support the growing agricultural communities in the region, and to provide much-needed water for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe in Towaoc. 

This year, they will be joining groups advocating for protection of the lower Dolores River through:

💦  A bill to designate a 75,000-acre National Conservation Area spanning from the base of McPhee Reservoir to the San Miguel/Montrose County line, which includes more than 70 miles of the Dolores River, establishes the Ponderosa Gorge Roadless Area, and protects special river values.

They’re partnering with Dolores River Boating Advocates in the effort to protect this beautiful river and surrounding lands.

"🌎 Happy Earth Day! 🌍 

Someday we may get to take the adventure beyond this planet, but we only get one Earth. Together, we can be proud of the work we’re doing to combat the climate crisis and protect our natural resources. 

Our planet is of the utmost importance to us and we view our public lands and their conservation as critical resources for our individual and collective wellbeing. Without deliberate action, we recognize that these resources are under threat. 

As a company, we actively work to reduce our footprint, whether in energy consumed, materials used or waste mitigated while, at the same time, partnering with organizations and non-profits with a proven track record in climate action, environmental hazard reduction, conservation and stewardship. 

Together, we can be proud of the work we’re doing to combat the climate crisis and protect our natural resources.

"""What advice would you give to someone who’s JUST getting started hiking, to encourage and support them?

I began my hiking career on the trails at Oconee Forest Park, a small wooded area behind the intramural sports fields at the University of Georgia. I didn’t really know what hiking was back then, and I didn’t own 'hiking clothes' or trail maps. It was basically impossible to get lost there, due to the small nature of it and the fact that every trail led back to a parking lot. I spent countless hours winding through the woods with my dogs, the trees a refuge from having my nose in textbooks and sitting under fluorescent lights in classrooms. There were no grand views, waterfalls, or picturesque destinations. Just woods, a stream, bugs and wildlife, and dirt beneath my feet.

My biggest piece of advice for someone who’s just starting is to just GO. The destination doesn’t have to be awe-inspiring. The hike doesn’t have to be epic. If you don’t know how to read a map, go where you don’t need one. You don’t have to have the best gear or even the right shoes. Find a safe wooded area near your home, wear whatever you already own, lace up whatever shoes you’ve got, and take a walk. Spend time with dirt under your feet and wind on your skin. Taste and smell the aroma of the trees and plants around you. Get used to the way your body moves on uneven terrain. Find your stride. Learn your pace and your stamina. Start where you’re at."" - @adventurelikeagirl | 📷 by @emtrod90 | Featured pack from the Manta/Mira Series

"We are excited to announce that the trailer for Nims' 14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible is out now.

14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible explores Nepal’s deep connection to high-altitude mountaineering through the eyes of Nirmal “Nimsdai” Purja, a fearless, fun-loving Nepali climber on a quest he dubs “Project Possible”—to summit all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter mountains in just seven months, breaking the previous record of seven years. With a team of skilled Sherpas, he traverses Mount Everest, K2, and other iconic peaks through extreme weather, life-or-death decisions, and the emotional weight of his mother’s illness back home. 14 Peaks is a thrilling, action-packed story about courage, perseverance, and pushing the limits of human endurance. Written, directed, and produced by Torquil Jones. Executive produced by Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi. Produced by Noah Media Group and Little Monster Films.

We cannot be more proud of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition—the many tribes whose voices have been heard—for fighting for this decision, and of our first Native American Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, who helped advocate for their cause.

This family of 7 (including their trail pup, Muir) has been checking off thru-hikes with the support of @thruhikesyndicate. In 2019 they completed the Pacific Crest Trail, in 2020 they hiked the Pacific Northwest Trail, this year they set out on the Continental Divide Trail, and next year they've got their eyes on the Appalachian Trail. 

Connection is at the heart of their experience: stepping away from the hustle and bustle, learning to adapt with changing conditions, troubleshooting as a family, and meeting new folks along the way.

"In 2019, #OspreyAmbassador @kyehalpin along with @freddy.most set out to find a creative route through the Tetons. The popular Teton Crest Trail covers the southern portion of the range but the northern section is a vast, often unexplored expanse with vague, undeveloped trails and difficult terrain. Their vision was to find a route traveling the entire length of the Tetons along the hydrological divide - the line where the water flows from either the west or the east. 

Following this line through the Tetons proved to be more of a challenge than either of them had expected and pushed them to the edge of their physical and psychological boundaries. Watch Teton Center Punch in full via the link in our bio.

For years we’ve been a sponsor of the Thru Hike Syndicate, an ambassador program for thru hikers that supports individuals on their hiking journeys that take them hundreds of miles across some of the most iconic long trails. After an unexpected season last year, we’re excited to bring back and support many ambassadors we selected for 2020, but are also thrilled to welcome new faces that altogether make up our 2021 Thru Hike Syndicate ambassador team!

As part of this program, we've been doing our best to navigate major trail organization recommendations for 2021, mandated and person safety precautions, and highly competitive permit systems. Hiking this year looks a lot different for all of us, which is why you’ll see both traditional and non-traditional long-distance hiking goals reflected within this year's team.

''On all of my expeditions since then, I dream about days when I return home, to create our own family adventures big and small. I see in my daughters a growing fascination of what adventures are out there waiting for them, and it stokes me so much that they are getting increasingly excited to explore in bigger way, and they have a big goal set for the near future!'' - Ray

This past year, the girls set specific goals, such as completing their first 20km trail run, which evolved into multiple trail runs over 20km. Each year, we’ve set a goal to go on a bigger adventure than the year before when dad gets home from expeditions. 

In 2020, the girls focused their goals on skiing groomers and backcountry, both skate and classic. Due to travel restrictions, our big winter adventure will have to wait, but we won’t let all this training be for not! This week’s ski was an awesome 24km loop with plenty of climbing and a few technical descents, which they go into a tuck, and I curl up into more of a fetal position ‘fear tuck’😂!

"""Embarking on any adventure and getting out in nature, is always an exhale for me. It is a feeling of stripping life down to the basics. It is a feeling of disconnecting to connect—with myself, those around me and the environments in which I find myself. It is refreshing and refueling. It soothes and nourishes my body, mind, heart and soul. It is a feeling of stepping off the grid to live a simpler life. A reminder of what really matters.

This year, more than ever, these exhales at the start of an outdoor adventure are the sweetest, most welcome feeling—especially when I don’t realize just how much I’ve been holding my breath.""

“What a journey. I’m humbled to say that as a team, we have summited the magnificent K2 in extreme winter conditions. We set out to make the impossible possible and we are honoured to be sharing this moment, not only with the Nepalese climbing community but with communities all across the world. ⁠

Mother nature always has bigger things to say and standing on the summit, witness to the sheer force of her extremities, we are proud to have been a part of history for humankind and to show that collaboration, teamwork and a positive mental attitude can push limits to what we feel might be possible. ⁠

Thank you for the support we’ve received from people all around the globe, it gave us fire in our chest to make this goal a reality.”

After patiently waiting for the perfect weather window, they summited what is known as the ‘Savage Mountain’. Until now, K2 was the last 8,000m peak in the world to be climbed during the wintertime.

"While nearby National Parks like Zion, Bryce, Arches, Capitol Reef, and Canyonlands get most the fanfare, southern Utah’s true hidden gem is Escalante, a weird, massive, and desolate landscape. Bordered by the aforementioned parks, the Colorado River on the east and Lake Powell to the south, the federally designated National Monument sprawls over hundreds of miles of rocks, sand, cactus, and the occasional oasis. 
—
To see the area, our group of 8 decided to tackle a 4-day bikepacking trip around the southern Utah desert. We would travel on a mix of roads–everything from rough gravel to paved highways, and try to camp near water sources so that we’d be able to cook each night. We ended up getting a bit more than we bargained for–280 miles in the desert sun will make your mind spin–but through the process and long days in the saddle, we learned something about ourselves and each other.

When I first hiked a section of Nüümü Poyo (the “people’s trail” in the Paiute language, also called the John Muir Trail) in 2014, I had just read Wild by Cheryl Strayed. A few years before, I’d read A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. I’d read John Krakauer’s Into the Wild. I’d read Alfred Lansing’s Endurance. As a kid, I’d read and re-read My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George. In 2014, these were my teachers: the people who ushered me into an idea of nature that I found both compelling and exclusive. I loved these books, and they confused me. I knew in my body that land and race and politics and nature are all lyrics to the same song, but it felt like every time these writers talked about going outside, they didn’t say boo about how white their version of outside was.
—
And I return the question to anyone who spends time outside: Who taught you how to be outside? Who teaches you? If your answer is a list of white men or women, know that your understanding of nature is incomplete and impoverished. Read Black, Indigenous, and Asian writers. Support organizations like @indigenouswomenhike , @outdoorafro, @wilddiversity, or @queernature that are working to shift narratives about the outdoors. Go outside, not as an escape from the world and its people, but as a way to connect with all of life more deeply.

With a career that usually revolves around competition and optimizing performance, a challenge that’s simply about finishing got Payson out of his comfort zone and back in touch with the inner child that first fell in love with the bike.

On Sunday August 16th, Osprey ambassador David Xiao was climbing with a partner on Mount Sir Donald near Revelstoke when he fell to his death.  Tuesday would have been his 26th birthday.
—
David had an infectious smile and shared his love of the outdoors with everyone he met. From climbing to skiing to thru-hiking, adventure was in his bones. He had a kind and curious soul; the type that radiates positivity and inspires you to try new things. From the lens of his camera, he passionately shared his adventures with us all, so that we too would fall in love with what he loved most.
—
“I was born and raised within a city of concrete and steel in China and never felt a connection to the outdoors as a kid. I remember the first time my friends took me on a hike after moving to Canada 12 years ago. To my surprise, a hike in the Canadian Rockies meant going out and climbing a mountain, not a walk in the park. I can still picture myself sitting on top of a ridge, mesmerized by the surrounding beauty, the freedom, the joy. I was introduced to a whole new world, a side of reality I never knew existed.”
—
As an Osprey ambassador, we had the joy of helping David pursue his passion for outdoor adventure. When he would talk about the PCT, he lit up. He jumped at every opportunity to share his expertise and knowledge if it would help somebody else try it for the first time.
—
When asked if he could make a 20 second phone call to himself at any point in your life, when would you call and what would you say,” his response was: To my 14-year-old self: Hey, you know that activity where people strap planks to their feet and slide down mountains really really fast? Sounds silly now but turns out you love it. Go try it now, trust me.
—
Thank you David, for sharing your love of the outdoors with so many and being part of the Osprey family. You have taught us to accept any challenge put in our path and to love big. We miss you so much. Rest in peace – may there be many mountains in Heaven for you to climb.",

"For the past couple weeks, we paused our posts to listen and support the black community and the many black voices that need to be heard. During this time, a global movement took place, inspiring a critical, long-overdue conversation and the beginning of much-needed systems change.
—
As an immediate small step, we donated to two organizations that work tirelessly to address the root causes of social injustice and systemic racism in America: NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (@naacp) and Color of Change (@colorofchange).
—
Moving forward, and with a heightened sense of purpose, we will continue the longstanding relationships we have with Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC)-focused organizations, like @outdoorafro, @navajo_yes, @latinooutdoors, and more; partner with content creators of color to highlight their work; use our platform to promote BIPOC voices in our blog and social channels; and hold internal meetings to evaluate and identify areas within our business that can be improved.
—
Within Osprey, we have been listening to the conversation, asking tough questions, educating ourselves and developing an action plan to make all communities feel safe, welcome and heard. Our DEI committee has a three-year roadmap in place that includes employee and manager training, department reviews, updated hiring practices, policy and procedure analysis, vision creation and employee culture surveys.

It has been a longstanding goal at Osprey to promote a more diverse community in the outdoors—and we are committed to the internal, long-term work required to further transform outdoor spaces into a more inclusive environment.",

"At our core, we are steadfast in our resolve to leave our world better than we found it. Because of that, we’re choosing not to stay silent on the events of this past week and our nation’s long history of systemic racism. We believe there is simply no place for hatred in our communities, in our outdoor spaces—anywhere in the world, period. We stand with the black community to condemn senseless deaths and injustices that permeate all facets of our society.
—
We realize sharing our beliefs is a small step, and we’re pushing ourselves to do better. Better starts with listening more and developing an evolving action plan.
—
Starting today, we plan to use our platform for good and to ensure BIPOC voices are heard—that means giving them a platform to speak about experiences, better representing people of color through all of our stories and diversifying the non-profits we partner with to better support our core values.
—
Our community is open and inclusive to all. Our differences fuel our strengths. Together we can end inequality—and we have no patience for those who say that’s impossible.

"""A little while back, I was able to take my daughter on this trip down the Caprock Canyons State Park Trailway. Easing this kid into more self-sufficiency has been a great experience, and she has really started to come into her own this year. We rode 13 gradually descending miles to the campsite on the western side of the Clarity Tunnel. We had a headwind, the temperature was never above 38 F, and mist and drops of rain were an occasional element. Although we stopped to grab a snack and explore a bit of the trailway’s history, we didn’t dottle, and Eva kept the pace moving. Like most kids, one of the more fun parts of camping is getting to and setting your site up. She wanted to be there. But, like most cyclists, she also wanted to simply put her head down and move through less than ideal conditions to our destination.
.
.
She never once complained, and after getting to camp, was nothing but a walking smile, briefly checking out the tunnel we we would explore the next morning, raiding the larder on my bike (even though she carried all her food on hers), and watching the mist and rain roll over the hills roughly undulating away from the Caprock Escarpment.""

This 4th grader became the official field assistant to entomologist and National Geographic Explorer, Dr. Isaí Madriz (@IsaiMadriz), who led the largest research expedition to record the behavior of the glacial stonefly (Andiperla sp.) last February. Dr. Madriz’s minimalist insect collection kit was contained within the Seral Pack, which became the ideal mobile lab for the young assistant.

The @atc is following the advice of the CDC and the WHO. This means closing ATC visitor’s centers and advising that “all section and thru-hikers to cancel or postpone their hikes.”⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The @cdtc also advises to “avoid discretionary travel” and also “urge you to stay home and enjoy your local trails and outdoor spaces.”⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The @PCTA ""asks all those who are already on the trail—as well as those waiting to start—to cancel or postpone your journeys.”⁠⠀

The @superiorhikingtrailassociation is asking that SHT users to “hike in place"".

"Dear Osprey friends and family,

In recent days we’ve been contacted by a number of you, faithful customers, sharing your stories of adventures delayed or rerouted close to home, even backyards. You sent photos of packed Osprey bags waiting patiently by the front door. You have shown determination, passion and grit, you have inspired us with your fortitude. You have also reminded us how important empathy is in times of crisis because all of you are telling us that you are not giving up. And neither would we. This bit of defiance, this statement of hope will serve as a guiding light for us here at Osprey. Your determination inspires us to take one step forward and then another. This trail is one we hike together.

During this time, osprey.com is open and all orders will ship free. To help support our retail partners, our dealer service team is taking orders and our dealer locator provides an up-to-date view of local store hours, inventory, curbside pick-up and same-day delivery options. Our distribution center is shipping everything.

For our Osprey team and the communities in which we operate, we have pivoted our priorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We have implemented a temporary telecommuting policy in our U.S. and European offices. If a role must be performed on-site, we are actively practicing social distancing, increased sanitization, and ensuring safe work environments and practices.

While our love of adventure has not dwindled in this trying time, we are finding moments to celebrate the outdoors responsibly. We believe adventure is open to anyone and found everywhere—even, and especially, in your own backyard.

As the situation evolves, we are doing our best to stay current and support the communities, partners and relationships we have fostered through our 46 years of business.

Please keep sending us your stories. How are you changing it up without giving it up? We’ll share the best ones with our audience to inspire. Whether you’re summiting lofty peaks in remote basement pillow forts or venturing out for everyday essentials—keep sharing because like you to us, we promise to remain faithfully at your side and together we shall prevail.",

In a land that could be compared in many ways to Yosemite, it was hard to believe that we had it all to ourselves, especially with the fall colors, perfect hiking temps, and sunshine.

During our trip, we met many warm locals who were eager to help us, talk to us (even without sharing a common tongue), and of course share their rakija and food with us. Aside from plenty of bonding time for our friendships to grow even stronger, we rested a LOT, laughed a LOT, slowed life down, put away our phones, and enjoyed getting far (VERY far) off the beaten path, together.

"This summer, a friend and I decided to go for an impromptu overnight camping trip on the summit of a nearby mountain called Mt. English. After bushwhacking for a few hours from the end of a logging road, we came to some beautiful alpine meadows with the wildflowers in full bloom. From here, we made our way up some scree, scrambled to the summit, and got cozy in our sleeping bags for the night. I stayed up and watched the milky way rise about the surrounding mountains on a moonless night-- it was so serene. I woke to frost on my sleeping bag and the sky slowly changing into hues of orange and red. This photo was taken just before leaving the summit, overlooking the glacier below.

"🎼 Takeover Alert! @benweavermusic will be taking over our feed for the rest of this week, talking about his Music For Free project and film. Follow along to  learn more! | Music for Free was a self-supported musical tour by bike in which I rode 3000 miles down the Continental Divide from Banff, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico. I carried my guitar and banjo on my bike giving free concerts to the people along the way. I was joined by filmmaker Keenan Desplanques who helped document the stories of the people I sang for. We completed the 3000 mile ride with 15 performances in 30 days. What follows are images from the Music for Free trip accompanied by my thoughts looking back on what the journey was about. Be sure to check out the upcoming Music for Free Film screening and concert tour to catch an event in your community. | Link to film in bio | 📷: @benweavermusic +@keendes | Featured pack from the Raptor/Raven Series #ospreypacks #musicforfree",
"Music for Free is about connecting athletic and artistic identities. Often time’s artist and athlete are not seen as one. I see little separation. The same thing that compels me to ride 150 miles through the dirt in a day, is that same thing that leaves me inspired to play a show at the end of that ride. The same mysterious force that brings forth creative acts is the same power that enables us to embrace the unknown in the middle of a blizzard, follow the uncertainties down a set of rapids, or trust our intuition hanging on the side of a piece of granite. It’s about listening to the louder voices that expand with possibility in the landscape around us. Making beautiful things out of the truth that within the unknown, the greatest moments of await. | 📷: @benweavermusic + @keendes | Featured pack from the Raptor/Raven Series #ospreypacks #musicforfree",

"Music for Free is about wildness. How does wildness differ from wilderness? How do we relate to wildness both inner and outer? How does our relationship to wildness connect to our ability to protect public land? Is wildness an inherent quality in all living things that connects each of us to each other, as well as all the other-than-human members of the ecosystems we share this planet with? Music for Free is about discovering and celebrating where our wildness overlap. It is about the rivers. The Grizzly. The Porcupine. The Columbine. The remaining glaciers, and listening to the wisdom they have to impart on us as we move through their homes. Music for Free is about honoring and strengthening relationships, it is about getting as close to the dark as an owl. Music for Free is about moving at the pace of the land. | 📷: @benweavermusic +@keendes | Featured pack from the Raptor/Raven Series |#ospreypacks #musicforfree",
"Change does not come from the middle. It comes from the edges. The bike leaves me spending an incredible amount of my time on the edge. Metaphorically, and literally speaking. I ride the edge of the road, this human made surface placed on top of and running through the natural systems. The edge of the road is a space of transition. The place where constant speed and progress butt right up against the rivers, trees and wild flowers. Music for Free is about living in that space at the edge and bringing some of its truth and magic a little closer to the middle. We discovered incredible people, with incredible truths, living among the remaining wild spaces of this landscape. In hindsight it should be no surprise. The miraculousness of your discoveries coincide with the miraculousness of the places you seek them out. The continental divide is the head waters of miraculousness in my opinion. | 📷: @benweavermusic +@keendes | Featured pack from the Raptor/Raven Series #ospreypacks #musicforfree",

"Did you know the idea for @smokeybear came about on August 9, 1944 and the bear quickly became a symbol for forest fire prevention. Not long after in the spring of 1950, a young American black bear cub was rescued from a forest fire in New Mexico. The firefighters named him Smokey because of his bravery. But what does this have to do with backpacking you ask? Well, Smokey and #ospreyambassador @drawingfromnature share the same birthday and to celebrate their milestones, Smokey turning 75 and Andrea turning 30, we teamed up to giveaway a custom painted Smokey Bear pack!

"UPDATE: We’ve heard your frustration in the comments about the lack of women on the CA team and want to address it. We went through an extensive search for this team that involved posting to IG, Facebook, various FB groups, emailing influential partners and organizations and much more. While that yielded a lot of applicants for the US team, we have some work to do in CA. Many women who applied had conflicting sponsorships or external issues that made them ineligible. This is an opportunity for you to send your nominations to marketing@insport.ca because at the end of the day, we’re on the same team 😊 If you look at our ambassador group as a whole, we are very proud to have 14 of the 23 members be rad women; from a future Olympian, a new Mom, an LGBTQ couple, an art professor and more, they are a phenomenal group! We want to celebrate that while also taking small steps to improve the program as a whole. Thank you for your support of this North American team and we hope to grow and expand in the near future. No brand is perfect but we’re proud of the group we have!

"“On my last morning on the PCT, I slung my Lumina onto my back, took a left onto the trail, and walked into the forest under low grey skies. With only 20 miles left to Canada, my pack had fully developed the characteristic thru-hiker smell: bologna, boiled cabbage, and body odor. But honestly, I’d stopped noticing the smell, I’d stopped noticing the backpack too. Great gear simply fades into the background of an experience, allowing you to be fully present, stoked, awed at what you’re about to accomplish.” - @pctassociation ambassador Kara Kieffer | Learn how to pick the perfect #thruhike pack for you via link in bio! | 📷: @kaymkieffer | #ospreypacks #thruhike #pct",
"""We hike less than we want to, but when we do get out, it’s so refreshing! For a while, we were hiking every Sunday and then I got pregnant.

This winter season we are committed to trying our best to get out once a week as a family to hike around our local trails.""- @steph.pollock

"""Mais qu'est ce qu'un PVT..? "", ""Oh, tu pars en vacances ?!"", ""Mais comment fais-tu pour financer ton voyage...?!"" ✈️

Autant de questions que l'on m'a fréquemment posées et qui reflètent bien le fait que ce programme n'est pas assez mis en avant par nos gouvernements et systèmes éducatifs !!! 🚦🛑

Le PVT (Programme Vacances Travail) est un accord entre deux pays permettant l'obtention d'un Visa de travail et de loisirs, en règle générale d'une durée de un an. Cela peut être moins, comme plus selon le pays en question 🇵🇪 / 🇫🇷

Il permet de choisir, d'alterner entre le travail, le volontariat🤝 (tel que le woofing, HelpX, Workaway...), et les visites d'un pays en ayant également la possibilité de se déplacer dans les pays aux alentours 🗺

Le PVT requiert malheureusement une limite d'âge 👼 et des économies 💰💶 afin de pouvoir subsister sur place sur les temps de loisirs...

C'est une belle expérience qui signifie immersion dans d'autres cultures🤠, d'autres traditions👩‍🌾, apprendre ou réapprendre une langue étrangère, des dialectes, partir à la rencontre de l'inconnu🗽 tout en ayant la sécurité d'obtenir un revenu si besoin 🪂

Il est fort dommage que celui-ci soit limité aux personnes de moins de 35/30 ans... Cela est mon avis personnel, car il n'y a pas d'âge pour découvrir le monde 🌍 Toutefois, le voyage est accessible à tous.tes par le biais du volontariat🤝, et chaque pays dispose plus ou moins d'une durée de Visa légale de 90 jours, ce qui peut être une belle expérience pour toute personne désirant vivre de nouvelles aventures ! ✨️🪅🎲

Croyons en nos rêves, et osons sortir de nos sentiers battus !

"‏لا أخفي عليك يا صديقي
أنا مرهق من السعي، 
مرهق من محاولات التجاوز والتأقلم، 
مرهق من الركض لمسافات طويلة والخطط والخطوات التي أفكر وأتخذها بشكل مستمر، 
مرهق من سرعة الأحداث في حياتي ومرهق من القرارات المصيرية والمسؤوليات والضغوطات..
مرهق من كل شيء لكنني أواصل عسى أجد راحتي في المستقبل القريب

"BLACK DIAMOND Distance 8L. |

Esta Distance 8, es realmente singular. La posicionaría a medio camino entre una mochila de aproximación y una de trail, y eso se nota en la resistencia de los materiales empleados, especialmente en la parte trasera de carga, si la comparamos con los modelos más populares.

¿Cómo se distribuye?

Parte trasera:
Zona de carga totalmente diáfana y 2 espacios laterales (casi ocultos para los bastones).
Tiene un pequeño bolsillo con cremallera interior, para teléfono, documentación etc. Me gusta.
Para llevar el sistema trasero de hidratación dispone de un espacio dedicado al que se accede por la única abertura.
El compartimento se abre y se cierra mediante un cordino tensor, y la solapa ‘enrollable’.
En los laterales, unos tensores para comprimir la carga.
El material es impermeable y resistente en extremo.

Parte delantera y lateral:
Tipo chaleco y bastante común, con espacio para bidones (no incluidos) y bolsillos superpuestos (izquierdo con cremallera).
En los laterales, también hay bolsillo de malla elástica con solapa.

Tiene un sistema portabastones, algo peculiar, y en mi opinión poco práctico. Tanto, que no lo uso.
La solución es introducir los bastones en el lateral (posición vertical) entre el tejido externo e interno (ojo aquí con las rosetas de los bastones para no romper nada).
Por lo demás, una mochila comodísima, capaz y resistente en zonas con vegetación cerrada. Totalmente a prueba de enganchones.
Los acabados son muy buenos, y la posición de los bidones, sumado al ajuste, hace que el rebote al correr sea inexistente.
Muy indicada para carreras que demandan cierta cantidad de material, y climatología adversa.
Si los 8 litros se te quedan cortos, existe una versión de 15 litros, por 175$.

¿Qué te parece esta mochila?

Vernäht habe ich für meinen neuen #sewingbackpack den wunderschönen Mandalastoff von @binebraendle den es gerade bei @binesstoffe gibt. Auch den tollen Innenstoff gibt es bei @binesstoffe. Den tollen Plot hat meine großartige Freundin Kathrin @___unikath___ selbst gemacht.

(Post 2 of 2)

On St. Patrick's Day, Robert, the manager of the Palace Hotel, gave us a ride back to the trailhead in the Pinos Altos, where Freebird had left off at the other day. We weren't walking far today, and were hoping to at least make it to Our Lady of Guadalupe Monastery for Vespers that evening. I don't recall the mileage there from the trailhead, but I think it was more or less 5 miles. We walked leisurely all afternoon, stopping to talk with a trail maintainer for a few hours. At that point we thought we were actually going to be late, but we found the side trail to the monastery and made it just in time. Brother Lawrence radiantly greeted us at the gift shop. He left and returned with bottled water, two Ziploc bags of apples and oranges, a box of electrolyte mixes, a bag of their Irish blend coffee (the monks there roast and sell coffee), and two Benedictine medals with an accompanying booklet about the saint. Lawrence gave us directions on how to locate our friend Doug the Hermit (See previous post: https://www.instagram.com/p/CuRyDkbLZxC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), whose place was off of our maps this year. We stayed for Vespers and then dropped back down the side trail, finding a place to camp on a ridge.

The next day the CDT circled around the monastery. We couldn't find the turnoff that led to Doug's place, so we continued on our route into the eastern end of the Pinos Altos. We crossed Highway 15, just north of Pinos Altos town, and camped in a ponderosa forest. On the 19th, a couple day-hikers from Silver City joined us for lunch. We gave them the coffee from Brother Lawrence, as we had no way of brewing it, nor did we want to carry that much.

Winter backpacking trek with the homie @kuehl_hauls . Trekked up Mt. Colden with no trail in sight and forged new paths via glissading down. Packed out in a lean-to for a night near Avalanche Pass and embraced the reward of a zero-degree night.

Ruhig geht der Tag von statten. Erst kurz zum Markt und etwas Obst kaufen. Danach zurück zum Hostel und den Laptop aufklappen.

Budget planen und die Ausgaben eintragen. Das neue Hostel buchen und dann den neuen Eintrag auf dem Blog veröffentlichen.

Am Abend geht es mit ein paar anderen Leuten zum stamm Restaurant und Informationen werden ausgetauscht, bis das Bett wartet und der Rucksack noch gepackt werden muss. Schnell noch eine Dusche und dann fallen die Augen zu.

This is a reminder that one needs to slow down, smell the flowers, and take in the view.

Speaking of the view, you can see some interior details of the Zelter Shelter such as the yellow inflatable bladder, dual-slider zip pulls, the sealed seams, and the storm flap. Hopefully you'll pick one up for your own adventures now that the weather is turning nice again and things are happening!

"Just five hours north of San Francisco sits a gem of the backpacking world, The Lost Coast. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would find such a remote and spectacular coastal destination in the most populous state in the US.

For five days we experienced mile after mile of pristine black sand beaches, old growth redwoods, herds of elk, barking sea lions, and the sound of ocean waves soothing us to sleep. We had the sense that we travelled to the far reaches of the earth, but strangely, no one stamped our passports. Repost: @rachid.dahnoun

"Do you ever remember the first place that left you absolutely breathless? For me that was the Scottish Highlands. I’ve never experienced somewhere so serene, peaceful and tranquil. Driving through them I’ve never been so overcome with gratitude to be able to see such a beautiful place. 

Where’s the most beautiful place you’ve experienced?

"Gym Review #3 

SciFitness 

A gym as uninspiring as the city itself. I haven’t been to many places that I’d absolutely never return to but Cebu is definitely one of them and this gym unfortunately followed in its city’s footstep. 

The gym itself is located on the third floor of a run down building on a busy street. On first impressions the actual gym looked like a good place to workout and at 100 pesos was very cheap, however, SciFitness’s biggest problem is that it is like working out in a Sauna with the demotivating music of Taylor Swift in the background. The heat and the music choice combined both contributed to a negative workout atmosphere. Don’t get me wrong the Philippines is a hot place but the lack of air con or open windows made working out for longer than 10 minutes and not ending up in a sweaty dripping mess nearly impossible. 

There are some positives to the gym though if you can bare the heat. 
1. The price is cheap.
2. There is a fair amount of equipment available and everything worked.
3. The staff are friendly and helpful. 

On the whole SciFitness has negative and positives if you want a cheap workout, can handle the heat and Taylor swift is your choice of workout music then SciFitness is for you. 

⭐️⭐️⭐️

"It’s almost 8 years since we quit the 9-5  life to travel the world, so I thought I’d share 8 important things I’ve learned along the way ❤️

1. Planning helps you discover hidden gems, but booking makes you rigid. Allow for spontaneity and flexibility with your plans and don’t book everything in advance. 

2. The connections you make on the road are deeper than you can imagine, and the people you meet understand you on a level that others can’t understand 🫶🏻 if you’re feeling like you’ve not met your tribe yet, solo travel! 

3. You need a lot less than you think you do. All the clutter and *stuff* that comes with a ‘settled’ life loses meaning, and you realise you need very little to be happy 😊

4. Travelling together makes your relationship more solid. We had to adjust to travelling together, and now we have such a great flow with travel that I hate doing it without him! 

5.  You have to go with an open mind to get the true benefits of travel. Try as many new experiences as you can, talk to everyone, eat everything, and don’t be afraid to look stupid or ask questions. It’s part of the process! 

6. Be able to say yes, no, hello, please, and thank you in the local language. It invites conversation and shows a willingness to learn about the culture! Think of how much you’ll learn over the years ❤️ 

7. You’ll only be nervous for a little bit, then your confidence will grow and you’ll be unstoppable! 

8. It’s not as hard or expensive as you think. Your mind just like to worry too much! 

Travel will grow your mind, change your outlook / goals / ambitions, and introduce you to the best people ❤️ Long term travellers, is there anything you would add?

Singapore!

Probably one of the most incredible places I’ve ever visited! I felt like I had just stepped foot on the Avatar movie set! And the best part is that it’s completely FREE to walk around here! 

There’s also a free light show every evening, at 7.45pm and 8.45pm, which is an absolute MUST!!
