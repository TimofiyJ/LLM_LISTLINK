"While navigating a myriad of life challenges, Anjelica Avella turned to the outdoors to improve her mental health only to discover a noticeable lack of other plus-size women of color on trail.

"“I knew I needed to find something that’d help me feel more alive; to challenge and reconnect with myself. I wanted to hike.” 

Celeste Thompson (@fatgirlforthefitsoul) rarely saw herself depicted in the activities and landscapes that called to her. But she didn’t let a lack of representation stop her from getting out on the trail.

Ten years after her first hiking experience, Celeste’s new goal is to hike every state in 2023.

"Inspired by his previous ""Crossing"" in Iceland last fall, #OspreyAthlete Payson McElveen @paysonmcelveen has knocked another traverse off his list. With the help of Tasmanian endurance rider @oneflukeshot, Payson pieced together a 360 mile route across Tasmania that crescendoed in difficulty, beginning on the wild, largely uninhabited northwestern coast and concluded on the white sand beaches of the Bay of Fires after 32 hours and over 34,000 feet of climbing. 

The island brought him face-to-face with three Tiger Snakes, one of the most venomous on the planet, hundreds of wallabies and wombats, and the friendly locals of Tasmania's rural communities.

The forthcoming film, produced in conjunction with Joey Schusler and Thomas Woodson and edited by Aidan Haley, will premier at the 2023 Sea Otter Classic and aims to share stories far beyond the athletic achievement of this ride.

"Did you know that we’re proud members of @conservationalliance who recently announced the Dolores River in Colorado as one of their four Advocacy Priority Campaigns for 2022? Beginning high in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado, it flows 230 miles until it joins the Colorado River in Utah’s red rock desert near Moab. McPhee Dam and Reservoir were built in the 1980’s to support the growing agricultural communities in the region, and to provide much-needed water for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe in Towaoc. 

This year, they will be joining groups advocating for protection of the lower Dolores River through:

💦  A bill to designate a 75,000-acre National Conservation Area spanning from the base of McPhee Reservoir to the San Miguel/Montrose County line, which includes more than 70 miles of the Dolores River, establishes the Ponderosa Gorge Roadless Area, and protects special river values.

They’re partnering with Dolores River Boating Advocates in the effort to protect this beautiful river and surrounding lands.

Participating in their annual Climb Against the Odds, she’s on the path to raise $6,000+ for breast cancer prevention. 

“I have family that have been exposed to breast cancer … but the reason I wanted to participate in [Climb Against the Odds] is because this is bigger than just climbing a mountain,” Kuhlman says. 

For her, this experience is about creating awareness around breast cancer and how we can better protect people and the environment from its risk factors—including toxic contamination.

While the great outdoors played a big part in their lives, one of the many threads that weave Heather and Jahmicah together is their shared sense of community. Both prioritizing inclusivity in the outdoors and the outdoor industry, they set out on a journey that would become one of the most memorable roller coasters of their lives. 

Today, we join Heather and Jahmicah Dawes in celebrating their 5th anniversary of @spoutfitter. Slim Pickins Outfitters (SPO)—the first Black-owned, independent outdoor retailer in the nation—can be found on the corner of Washington St. and Belknap Ave in Stephenville, Texas.

Growing up, Jessica Baker discovered a love for skiing—even if her first day on the slopes didn’t go swimmingly. As an adult, competing and guiding on some of the most beautiful mountains here and abroad, she recognized a gap in the industry: there weren’t many female leaders to show her the way. Her solution? Ski Divas. 

Baker has become the leader she wishes she always had, leading other women from all backgrounds on memorable ski retreats and organizing the industry’s first BIWOC ski camps—with the next one coming up this month.

"""What advice would you give to someone who’s JUST getting started hiking, to encourage and support them?

I began my hiking career on the trails at Oconee Forest Park, a small wooded area behind the intramural sports fields at the University of Georgia. I didn’t really know what hiking was back then, and I didn’t own 'hiking clothes' or trail maps. It was basically impossible to get lost there, due to the small nature of it and the fact that every trail led back to a parking lot. I spent countless hours winding through the woods with my dogs, the trees a refuge from having my nose in textbooks and sitting under fluorescent lights in classrooms. There were no grand views, waterfalls, or picturesque destinations. Just woods, a stream, bugs and wildlife, and dirt beneath my feet.

My biggest piece of advice for someone who’s just starting is to just GO. The destination doesn’t have to be awe-inspiring. The hike doesn’t have to be epic. If you don’t know how to read a map, go where you don’t need one. You don’t have to have the best gear or even the right shoes. Find a safe wooded area near your home, wear whatever you already own, lace up whatever shoes you’ve got, and take a walk. Spend time with dirt under your feet and wind on your skin. Taste and smell the aroma of the trees and plants around you. Get used to the way your body moves on uneven terrain. Find your stride. Learn your pace and your stamina. Start where you’re at."" - @adventurelikeagirl | 📷 by @emtrod90 | Featured pack from the Manta/Mira Series

14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible explores Nepal’s deep connection to high-altitude mountaineering through the eyes of Nirmal “Nimsdai” Purja, a fearless, fun-loving Nepali climber on a quest he dubs “Project Possible”—to summit all 14 of the world’s 8,000-meter mountains in just seven months, breaking the previous record of seven years. With a team of skilled Sherpas, he traverses Mount Everest, K2, and other iconic peaks through extreme weather, life-or-death decisions, and the emotional weight of his mother’s illness back home. 14 Peaks is a thrilling, action-packed story about courage, perseverance, and pushing the limits of human endurance. Written, directed, and produced by Torquil Jones. Executive produced by Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi. Produced by Noah Media Group and Little Monster Films.

Not only is this a landmark decision for the conservation of these cherished monuments—it is a tremendous win for the Native Americans, whose culture, history and heritage are tied to and preserved throughout these sacred places, as well as our partners who are committed to the protection of our public lands. 

We cannot be more proud of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition—the many tribes whose voices have been heard—for fighting for this decision, and of our first Native American Secretary of the Interior, Deb Haaland, who helped advocate for their cause.

Connection is at the heart of their experience: stepping away from the hustle and bustle, learning to adapt with changing conditions, troubleshooting as a family, and meeting new folks along the way.

"At Osprey, we embrace opportunities to prop up and celebrate the people and causes that promote inclusivity and empower us to learn, grow and explore outside, no matter our identity, gender or sexuality.

We’re proud to sponsor The Venture Out Project, which leads backpacking and wilderness trips for the LGBTQ+ community. In celebration of Pride Month, we’re donating $10 for every Osprey Pride shirt sold. Donations to @theventureoutproject help with their general non-profit operations, as well as provide funding to help lower costs and support members of the LGBTQ+ community who wouldn’t be able to afford their outings otherwise.

To our LGBTQ+ friends, co-workers, customers and co-adventurers, we can’t wait to meet you out on the trail soon!

"In 2019, #OspreyAmbassador @kyehalpin along with @freddy.most set out to find a creative route through the Tetons. The popular Teton Crest Trail covers the southern portion of the range but the northern section is a vast, often unexplored expanse with vague, undeveloped trails and difficult terrain. Their vision was to find a route traveling the entire length of the Tetons along the hydrological divide - the line where the water flows from either the west or the east. 

Following this line through the Tetons proved to be more of a challenge than either of them had expected and pushed them to the edge of their physical and psychological boundaries. Watch Teton Center Punch in full via the link in our bio.

"Say hello to the 2021 Thru Hike Syndicate ambassador team! 👋

For years we’ve been a sponsor of the Thru Hike Syndicate, an ambassador program for thru hikers that supports individuals on their hiking journeys that take them hundreds of miles across some of the most iconic long trails. After an unexpected season last year, we’re excited to bring back and support many ambassadors we selected for 2020, but are also thrilled to welcome new faces that altogether make up our 2021 Thru Hike Syndicate ambassador team! We will be sponsoring these hikers with backpacks to complement gear from the awesome teams at @darntoughvermont, @ledlenserusa, @nemoequipment, @peakrefuel, @vasquefootwear, @lekiusa, and @sawyerproducts.

As part of this program, we've been doing our best to navigate major trail organization recommendations for 2021, mandated and person safety precautions, and highly competitive permit systems. Hiking this year looks a lot different for all of us, which is why you’ll see both traditional and non-traditional long-distance hiking goals reflected within this year's team. As a sponsor of this program, we’re excited and honored to be telling the story of each ambassador’s unique journey this season. 

Join us in welcoming this awesome crew! 👏",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each year, we’ve set a goal to go on a bigger adventure than the year before when dad gets home from expeditions. 

In 2020, the girls focused their goals on skiing groomers and backcountry, both skate and classic. Due to travel restrictions, our big winter adventure will have to wait, but we won’t let all this training be for not! This week’s ski was an awesome 24km loop with plenty of climbing and a few technical descents, which they go into a tuck, and I curl up into more of a fetal position ‘fear tuck’😂!

Mother nature always has bigger things to say and standing on the summit, witness to the sheer force of her extremities, we are proud to have been a part of history for humankind and to show that collaboration, teamwork and a positive mental attitude can push limits to what we feel might be possible. ⁠

Thank you for the support we’ve received from people all around the globe, it gave us fire in our chest to make this goal a reality.”

After patiently waiting for the perfect weather window, they summited what is known as the ‘Savage Mountain’. Until now, K2 was the last 8,000m peak in the world to be climbed during the wintertime.

"While nearby National Parks like Zion, Bryce, Arches, Capitol Reef, and Canyonlands get most the fanfare, southern Utah’s true hidden gem is Escalante, a weird, massive, and desolate landscape. Bordered by the aforementioned parks, the Colorado River on the east and Lake Powell to the south, the federally designated National Monument sprawls over hundreds of miles of rocks, sand, cactus, and the occasional oasis.

To see the area, our group of 8 decided to tackle a 4-day bikepacking trip around the southern Utah desert. We would travel on a mix of roads–everything from rough gravel to paved highways, and try to camp near water sources so that we’d be able to cook each night. We ended up getting a bit more than we bargained for–280 miles in the desert sun will make your mind spin–but through the process and long days in the saddle, we learned something about ourselves and each other.

When I first hiked a section of Nüümü Poyo (the “people’s trail” in the Paiute language, also called the John Muir Trail) in 2014, I had just read Wild by Cheryl Strayed. A few years before, I’d read A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson. I’d read John Krakauer’s Into the Wild. I’d read Alfred Lansing’s Endurance. As a kid, I’d read and re-read My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George. In 2014, these were my teachers: the people who ushered me into an idea of nature that I found both compelling and exclusive. I loved these books, and they confused me. I knew in my body that land and race and politics and nature are all lyrics to the same song, but it felt like every time these writers talked about going outside, they didn’t say boo about how white their version of outside was.
—
And I return the question to anyone who spends time outside: Who taught you how to be outside? Who teaches you? If your answer is a list of white men or women, know that your understanding of nature is incomplete and impoverished. Read Black, Indigenous, and Asian writers. Support organizations like @indigenouswomenhike , @outdoorafro, @wilddiversity, or @queernature that are working to shift narratives about the outdoors. Go outside, not as an escape from the world and its people, but as a way to connect with all of life more deeply.

"""During cancer, I was no longer in control of my body–I was pumped with chemicals and I moved from treatment to treatment. For some of my treatments, I was in my hospital room for days without being able to go outside or walk untethered by crutches and an IV pole.

On Sunday August 16th, Osprey ambassador David Xiao was climbing with a partner on Mount Sir Donald near Revelstoke when he fell to his death.  Tuesday would have been his 26th birthday.
—
David had an infectious smile and shared his love of the outdoors with everyone he met. From climbing to skiing to thru-hiking, adventure was in his bones. He had a kind and curious soul; the type that radiates positivity and inspires you to try new things. From the lens of his camera, he passionately shared his adventures with us all, so that we too would fall in love with what he loved most.
—
“I was born and raised within a city of concrete and steel in China and never felt a connection to the outdoors as a kid. I remember the first time my friends took me on a hike after moving to Canada 12 years ago. To my surprise, a hike in the Canadian Rockies meant going out and climbing a mountain, not a walk in the park. I can still picture myself sitting on top of a ridge, mesmerized by the surrounding beauty, the freedom, the joy. I was introduced to a whole new world, a side of reality I never knew existed.”
—
As an Osprey ambassador, we had the joy of helping David pursue his passion for outdoor adventure. When he would talk about the PCT, he lit up. He jumped at every opportunity to share his expertise and knowledge if it would help somebody else try it for the first time.
—
When asked if he could make a 20 second phone call to himself at any point in your life, when would you call and what would you say,” his response was: To my 14-year-old self: Hey, you know that activity where people strap planks to their feet and slide down mountains really really fast? Sounds silly now but turns out you love it. Go try it now, trust me.
—
Thank you David, for sharing your love of the outdoors with so many and being part of the Osprey family. You have taught us to accept any challenge put in our path and to love big. We miss you so much. Rest in peace – may there be many mountains in Heaven for you to climb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"For the past couple weeks, we paused our posts to listen and support the black community and the many black voices that need to be heard. During this time, a global movement took place, inspiring a critical, long-overdue conversation and the beginning of much-needed systems change.
—
As an immediate small step, we donated to two organizations that work tirelessly to address the root causes of social injustice and systemic racism in America: NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (@naacp) and Color of Change (@colorofchange).
—
Moving forward, and with a heightened sense of purpose, we will continue the longstanding relationships we have with Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC)-focused organizations, like @outdoorafro, @navajo_yes, @latinooutdoors, and more; partner with content creators of color to highlight their work; use our platform to promote BIPOC voices in our blog and social channels; and hold internal meetings to evaluate and identify areas within our business that can be improved.
—
Within Osprey, we have been listening to the conversation, asking tough questions, educating ourselves and developing an action plan to make all communities feel safe, welcome and heard. Our DEI committee has a three-year roadmap in place that includes employee and manager training, department reviews, updated hiring practices, policy and procedure analysis, vision creation and employee culture surveys.

It has been a longstanding goal at Osprey to promote a more diverse community in the outdoors—and we are committed to the internal, long-term work required to further transform outdoor spaces into a more inclusive environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"At our core, we are steadfast in our resolve to leave our world better than we found it. Because of that, we’re choosing not to stay silent on the events of this past week and our nation’s long history of systemic racism. We believe there is simply no place for hatred in our communities, in our outdoor spaces—anywhere in the world, period. We stand with the black community to condemn senseless deaths and injustices that permeate all facets of our society.
—
We realize sharing our beliefs is a small step, and we’re pushing ourselves to do better. Better starts with listening more and developing an evolving action plan.
—
Starting today, we plan to use our platform for good and to ensure BIPOC voices are heard—that means giving them a platform to speak about experiences, better representing people of color through all of our stories and diversifying the non-profits we partner with to better support our core values.
—
Our community is open and inclusive to all. Our differences fuel our strengths. Together we can end inequality—and we have no patience for those who say that’s impossible.

"""A little while back, I was able to take my daughter on this trip down the Caprock Canyons State Park Trailway. Easing this kid into more self-sufficiency has been a great experience, and she has really started to come into her own this year. We rode 13 gradually descending miles to the campsite on the western side of the Clarity Tunnel. We had a headwind, the temperature was never above 38 F, and mist and drops of rain were an occasional element. Although we stopped to grab a snack and explore a bit of the trailway’s history, we didn’t dottle, and Eva kept the pace moving. Like most kids, one of the more fun parts of camping is getting to and setting your site up. She wanted to be there. But, like most cyclists, she also wanted to simply put her head down and move through less than ideal conditions to our destination.
.
.
She never once complained, and after getting to camp, was nothing but a walking smile, briefly checking out the tunnel we we would explore the next morning, raiding the larder on my bike (even though she carried all her food on hers), and watching the mist and rain roll over the hills roughly undulating away from the Caprock Escarpment.""

"The schools Nichole visits focus on elementary aged students, which includes students who are testing into secondary school. It is often the case that many students do not have electricity or power in the home and cannot study past dark. Providing solar lights to these students allows them to study past sunset and into the dark of night, increasing their odds at successfully passing examinations. Many of her stops are impromptu, encouraged by smiling faces and running children who are curious about her bicycle.

"""The right pack can make you see the world in a different way. This rang true for Matias, the youngest member of a scientific expedition to Glacial Exploradores in the heart of Chilean Patagonia. This 4th grader became the official field assistant to entomologist and National Geographic Explorer, Dr. Isaí Madriz (@IsaiMadriz), who led the largest research expedition to record the behavior of the glacial stonefly (Andiperla sp.) last February. Dr. Madriz’s minimalist insect collection kit was contained within the Seral Pack, which became the ideal mobile lab for the young assistant. Matias loved it so much he nicknamed it “Nerd Pack: Full Edition”, as it contained everything a 9-year-old entomologist could wish for. At the end of the expedition Matias gained a whole new appreciation for the natural world surrounding him, so much so that he asked his dad (featured in the third photo, @patagontorres) for a “Nerd Pack: Full Edition” for his next birthday.

"This week we’ve been doing our best to educate ourselves and stay updated on the latest happenings on our country’s thru hike trails. That being said, @thruhikesyndicate has provided the latest information and recommendations to all of our Thru Hike Syndicate ambassadors regarding their respective trail plans. Based on some of the latest recommendations, we have also strongly advised all on-trail ambassadors to leave the trail immediately or find adequate shelter, for their safety, and the safety of the communities along the trails. We’ll continue to update our ambassadors with the latest news and will work with them to find solutions as the situation evolves, whether that means postponing or finding another hike option for the season. We will continue providing important updates as they become available, and sharing content that encourages inspiring and happy mountain memories. Wherever you are in the world, we hope that you continue to safely recreate and find healing in nature.⁠
@thruhikesyndicate has summarized the latest guidance from some of America’s thru-hike trail associations:⠀
.⁠⠀
The @atc is following the advice of the CDC and the WHO. This means closing ATC visitor’s centers and advising that “all section and thru-hikers to cancel or postpone their hikes.”⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The @cdtc also advises to “avoid discretionary travel” and also “urge you to stay home and enjoy your local trails and outdoor spaces.”⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The @PCTA ""asks all those who are already on the trail—as well as those waiting to start—to cancel or postpone your journeys.”⁠⠀
.⁠⠀
The @superiorhikingtrailassociation is asking that SHT users to “hike in place"".

"Dear Osprey friends and family,

In recent days we’ve been contacted by a number of you, faithful customers, sharing your stories of adventures delayed or rerouted close to home, even backyards. You sent photos of packed Osprey bags waiting patiently by the front door. You have shown determination, passion and grit, you have inspired us with your fortitude. You have also reminded us how important empathy is in times of crisis because all of you are telling us that you are not giving up. And neither would we. This bit of defiance, this statement of hope will serve as a guiding light for us here at Osprey. Your determination inspires us to take one step forward and then another. This trail is one we hike together.

During this time, osprey.com is open and all orders will ship free. To help support our retail partners, our dealer service team is taking orders and our dealer locator provides an up-to-date view of local store hours, inventory, curbside pick-up and same-day delivery options. Our distribution center is shipping everything.

For our Osprey team and the communities in which we operate, we have pivoted our priorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We have implemented a temporary telecommuting policy in our U.S. and European offices. If a role must be performed on-site, we are actively practicing social distancing, increased sanitization, and ensuring safe work environments and practices.

While our love of adventure has not dwindled in this trying time, we are finding moments to celebrate the outdoors responsibly. We believe adventure is open to anyone and found everywhere—even, and especially, in your own backyard.

As the situation evolves, we are doing our best to stay current and support the communities, partners and relationships we have fostered through our 46 years of business.

Please keep sending us your stories. How are you changing it up without giving it up? We’ll share the best ones with our audience to inspire. Whether you’re summiting lofty peaks in remote basement pillow forts or venturing out for everyday essentials—keep sharing because like you to us, we promise to remain faithfully at your side and together we shall prevail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were very interested in seeing things, feeling the breeze, and feeling the warmth of the sun on chilly mornings. They were always smiling and giggling when they saw each other in the carriers. At the age of 2 ½, we got rid of the carriers and they were hiking on their own.""

"Four of my girlfriends and I spent four days backpacking on the Via Dinarica from outside of Sarajevo to Sutjeska National Park in Bosnia. We saw zero other hikers on the trail the entire way. ZERO! In a land that could be compared in many ways to Yosemite, it was hard to believe that we had it all to ourselves, especially with the fall colors, perfect hiking temps, and sunshine.

During our trip, we met many warm locals who were eager to help us, talk to us (even without sharing a common tongue), and of course share their rakija and food with us. Aside from plenty of bonding time for our friendships to grow even stronger, we rested a LOT, laughed a LOT, slowed life down, put away our phones, and enjoyed getting far (VERY far) off the beaten path, together.

I needed that time desperately, and I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to finally experience a section of the Via Dinarica with my badass female dream team. | 📷@travelingjackie | Featured pack from the Farpoint/Fairview, Levity/Lumina Series #ospreypacks #ospreyambassador",ospreypacks,ospreyambassador,,,,,,,,,,,,

"This summer, a friend and I decided to go for an impromptu overnight camping trip on the summit of a nearby mountain called Mt. English. After bushwhacking for a few hours from the end of a logging road, we came to some beautiful alpine meadows with the wildflowers in full bloom. From here, we made our way up some scree, scrambled to the summit, and got cozy in our sleeping bags for the night. I stayed up and watched the milky way rise about the surrounding mountains on a moonless night-- it was so serene. I woke to frost on my sleeping bag and the sky slowly changing into hues of orange and red. This photo was taken just before leaving the summit, overlooking the glacier below.

"""I distinctly remember the first time that climbing Denali with a group of women was brought up to me. I was dressed in some ridiculous outfit for closing day at Monarch Mountain in Colorado and I ran into a friend I hadn’t seen in a really long time. He happened to be the Field Director for Veterans Expeditions and he told me he really thought I should consider the Women’s Denali Expedition in 2019. My initial reaction was “No thanks, I want to keep my toes.""
🔸 🔸
 In hindsight, I am so grateful that I ran into him that day and that he convinced me to show up for the first training session. Climbing Denali with four other women veterans was an experience that I will never forget, and will always be grateful for. | #OspreyPacks is proud to support @veterans_expeditions, a veteran-led nonprofit focused on empowering veterans by providing leadership opportunities in the outdoors.

Along the way, you’ll pass the Windy Point viewpoint, the old snowsheds and the long tunnel going into Wellington.

"🎼 Takeover Alert! @benweavermusic will be taking over our feed for the rest of this week, talking about his Music For Free project and film. Follow along to  learn more! | Music for Free was a self-supported musical tour by bike in which I rode 3000 miles down the Continental Divide from Banff, Canada to Antelope Wells, New Mexico. I carried my guitar and banjo on my bike giving free concerts to the people along the way. I was joined by filmmaker Keenan Desplanques who helped document the stories of the people I sang for. We completed the 3000 mile ride with 15 performances in 30 days. What follows are images from the Music for Free trip accompanied by my thoughts looking back on what the journey was about. Be sure to check out the upcoming Music for Free Film screening and concert tour to catch an event in your community. | Link to film in bio | 📷: @benweavermusic +@keendes | Featured pack from the Raptor/Raven Series #ospreypacks #musicforfree",ospreypacks,musicforfree,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Music for Free is about connecting athletic and artistic identities. Often time’s artist and athlete are not seen as one. I see little separation. The same thing that compels me to ride 150 miles through the dirt in a day, is that same thing that leaves me inspired to play a show at the end of that ride. The same mysterious force that brings forth creative acts is the same power that enables us to embrace the unknown in the middle of a blizzard, follow the uncertainties down a set of rapids, or trust our intuition hanging on the side of a piece of granite. It’s about listening to the louder voices that expand with possibility in the landscape around us. Making beautiful things out of the truth that within the unknown, the greatest moments of await. | 📷: @benweavermusic + @keendes | Featured pack from the Raptor/Raven Series #ospreypacks #musicforfree",ospreypacks,musicforfree,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Music for Free is about wildness. How does wildness differ from wilderness? How do we relate to wildness both inner and outer? How does our relationship to wildness connect to our ability to protect public land? Is wildness an inherent quality in all living things that connects each of us to each other, as well as all the other-than-human members of the ecosystems we share this planet with? Music for Free is about discovering and celebrating where our wildness overlap. It is about the rivers. The Grizzly. The Porcupine. The Columbine. The remaining glaciers, and listening to the wisdom they have to impart on us as we move through their homes. Music for Free is about honoring and strengthening relationships, it is about getting as close to the dark as an owl.

"Change does not come from the middle. It comes from the edges. The bike leaves me spending an incredible amount of my time on the edge. Metaphorically, and literally speaking. I ride the edge of the road, this human made surface placed on top of and running through the natural systems. The edge of the road is a space of transition. The place where constant speed and progress butt right up against the rivers, trees and wild flowers. Music for Free is about living in that space at the edge and bringing some of its truth and magic a little closer to the middle. We discovered incredible people, with incredible truths, living among the remaining wild spaces of this landscape. In hindsight it should be no surprise. The miraculousness of your discoveries coincide with the miraculousness of the places you seek them out. The continental divide is the head waters of miraculousness in my opinion. | 📷: @benweavermusic +@keendes | Featured pack from the Raptor/Raven Series #ospreypacks #musicforfree",ospreypacks,musicforfree,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not long after in the spring of 1950, a young American black bear cub was rescued from a forest fire in New Mexico. The firefighters named him Smokey because of his bravery. But what does this have to do with backpacking you ask? Well, Smokey and #ospreyambassador @drawingfromnature share the same birthday and to celebrate their milestones, Smokey turning 75 and Andrea turning 30, we teamed up to giveaway a custom painted Smokey Bear pack!

This is an opportunity for you to send your nominations to marketing@insport.ca because at the end of the day, we’re on the same team 😊 If you look at our ambassador group as a whole, we are very proud to have 14 of the 23 members be rad women; from a future Olympian, a new Mom, an LGBTQ couple, an art professor and more, they are a phenomenal group!

Leading up to this I had spent countless days outside hiking around central Massachusetts and the White Mountains of New Hampshire, but had never done a multi-night trip. Shortly after this, I began rock climbing, and just couldn’t imagine how the top of those jagged cliffs creating an amphitheater around Cirque Lake could be accessible. This trip turn out to be the genesis of my interest in rock climbing, something I haven’t stopped pouring time and effort into since. | Read Dan’s full story via link in bio | 📷: @s0uth_paw + @johnribes | #ospreypacks #keepitwild #thegooddaysaremade",ospreypacks,keepitwild,thegooddaysaremade,,,,,,,,,,,
